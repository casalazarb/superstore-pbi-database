Database modeling and implementation for a multinational superstore.

# Superstore Database Project

Welcome to the Superstore Database Project! This repository showcases my expertise in relational database design, SQL ingestion, and data visualization using 
Microsoft SQL Server, Transact-SQL, and Power BI. The project focuses on designing a database for a fictional superstore, normalizing the relationships between data, 
ingesting data from Excel spreadsheets, and creating insightful visualizations for business intelligence purposes.

# Project Overview

## Database Design
Utilized industry-standard practices to design a relational database schema for the superstore.
Employed normalization techniques to ensure data integrity, eliminate redundancy, and optimize query performance.
The logical model of the database is represented in Crow's Foot notation using Visio and SQL Server diagrams, providing a comprehensive understanding of the 
database structure.

## Data Ingestion
Ingested data from Excel spreadsheets into a Microsoft SQL Server database using Transact-SQL.
Each sheet in the Excel spreadsheet corresponds to a table in the logical model, facilitating seamless data migration.
Ensured data accuracy and consistency during the ingestion process.

## Data Visualization with Power BI
Leveraged Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations based on the ingested data.
Transformed raw data into meaningful insights and actionable business intelligence.
Provided management with intuitive dashboards to monitor key performance indicators and make informed decisions.

## Business Analysis
Answered business questions for management by executing Transact-SQL queries directly on the SQL Server database.
Replicated the same business questions' analysis and visualization through Power BI, offering multiple avenues for data exploration 
and interpretation. Demonstrated proficiency in data analysis, SQL querying, and data visualization techniques.
